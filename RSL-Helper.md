# RSL Helper & Why it's so good

**Used correctly, this will allow you to spend all of your energy regen, gems, refills and save on multi battles**

**⚠️NEVER GO TO SLEEP RELYING ON RSL TO FINISH AN EVENT THAT WILL END WHILE YOU SLEEP. THERE COULD BE AN UPDATE, A LEVELUP WINDOW, OR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS THAT MAKE IT STOP DURING THE NIGHT, POSSIBLY MAKING YOU MISS OUT ON A FUSION⚠️**

**Always be in the window in game of whatever content you're planning on running, with your initial team already selected, before telling RSL Helper to run. See below**

## Food training

This is arguably the one that will save the most time and effort. 

⚠️You will not be able to do mixes of various levels. (I.e: You can't make RSL helper do 7 runs on 12-3 brutal and one on normal for example)

### Levelling for champ training

For champ training, you'll be wanting to maximize points, so you want to go with partially levelling champs. For this, just select multi level xp, click on the set food button, select "use level limit" at the top right, and then set your target levels you'll be wanting. I tend to go one of two paths :

**When I'm short on food**
- 7 for 2* (1 battle)
- 12 for 3* (3 battles)
- 18 for 4* (~5 battles)
- 24 for 5* (~8 battles)

**When I have plenty of food available**
- None for 2*
- 7 for 3* (1 battle)
- 13-16 for 4* (4-5 battles)
- 20 for 5* (6-7 battles)

Once that's done, just select your champions until you have enough, and hit run at the bottom left. **Be sure to have the first 3 you'll be training selected in game. It doesn't quite work like the multi battle queue**

### General food training
Two options: 

- Either you have a full queue of champs you want to bring to max level, in which case you do the above method, just set the level limit to the max level (20 for 2\*, 30 for 3, etc..)
- Or you just want 3 of them levelled, in which case you prep the team, check the "Max level" option, and hit run.

## Events and dungeon runs

If you click on the event icon at the top left, near target event points, you can select a specific tournament/event, select the point threshold you want to reach, be in the battle window of the dungeon in question with your team selected, and hit run. It'll spend energy depending on your settings until it gets you there.

## Various settings

There are a few very interesting ones, that can help overnight mainly. 

### Start time
Off to bed and an event starts in 4 hours so you don't want to waste energy before then? No problem. Set the timer to start in 4 hours, hit run, walk away, and sleep peacefully knowing it's running for you.

### Run effective resources
Probably my favorite setting, because I use it for everything. Just hit effective resources, and run whatever you please. **It will spend all energy regen, as soon as it has enough to run the content you're on, until you tell it to stop.**

### Auto refill & Max Refills
Same concept as multi battles here, it will spend gems/energy refills you have banked to continue running until it hits an objective you defined above, like an event target, or until it hits the Max refill limit.

# Fusion *a la* Peanuts

## Preface
This is mainly from the point of view of someone who completed two fusions in his first 90 days, and learned the hard way by missing his shot at his first fusion (Gnut), that resource management is fucking important.
My spending has been minimal (One shard pack early on before I wisened up on their futility, one forge pass, one raid card, and one energy pack. I could have done without all of these), and I am trying to approach everything here as much as possible with a fully F2P reasoning
**If by following anything in here, something goes wrong, tough shit, try again. I did this for 2 fusions as of this writing, it worked great.**
### Breakdown

In short, any fusion is going to boil down to three things : 
- Shards
- Energy
- Time

With enough of the first two, any fusion can be completed with a little of the third. You can make up for lack of energy with time, to an extent, **but you can't really make up for shards** with anything but your wallet. And we don't want that.

With that out of the way, let's get to the actual tips I can have.

## Preparing for fusions
There are essentially three phases for this.
- Between fusions
- Week before
- Fusion itself
How much you prepare/organise at each phase, will determine how easily you can accomplish the fusion.

### Between fusions
For the most part, this is where you do all the shit you've been putting off. Run Mino, Run potion keeps, Run Twins, Run whatever the hell you couldn't because it's not an event because god fucking forbid dungeon divers actually works for all dungeons eh? 
Progress missions are also a very good thing to tackle in between fusions, as they are another source of shards.
**But this is also the part where you will have the most freedom to prepare everything necessary for a fusion**

#### The big don'ts ðŸš«
- **Don't open any shard, besides the 3 daily mystery shards for quests**
- **Don't spend any gem, unless exceptional circumstances, and you have a healthy supply**
- **Don't use energy refills, unless exceptional circumstances, and you have a healthy supply of them or a very healthy supply of gems**
- **Don't do random events unless you need/want the rewards, and can afford it**
- **Don't burn all your food**
- **Don't burn all your potions**
- **Don't burn all your silver**

#### The market
This is, for me, the basis of a fusion as an early-mid game account. A sizeable chunk of your silver will be going here. You will be buying three (3) things.
- Mystery shards
- 2* champions
- Ancient shards (Those 5 first per month you get in the first 2 days and are then left sitting there like Pablo Escobar for the rest of the fucking month)

Now, "Peanuts!" you may say, "2* champs are expensive" you may say. And right you would be. But 2* champs are Summon Rush points, Champ chase points and Champ training points you're prepping ahead of time, with silver, by **not opening any mystery shards besides the daily 3**.
So buy them. Buy them all until you've filled your vaults.

Ancients are self-explanatory.

**TL;DR: Buy Mystery & Ancient shards, fill your reserve vault with 2\* food or better**

#### Gems & Energy refills
Pretty self explanatory as well. Both for champ chase, and for DD, the energy requirements are rough. Even more so when you can't reliably clear 20, and you're stuck on fucking Fire Knight 10, because your team is garbage. Hoard them all. 
The only times I would say to dip into them, are if you're very close to PCvC reward tiers, or for events where you're already close to a good reward, like champ training and lego books.

You're going to ideally want the equivalent of 2400 gems to be safe, at least. That equates to 7200 energy, if you're level 50. That, with the daily energy, should cover your energy needs quite tidily. If you have refills, substract 40 gems per refill you have in your inbox.

**TL;DR: Save everything you get to have about 7-8k energy readily available**

#### Silver management
Silver is energy, so to avoid needing too much, and running stuff out of events during fusions, you're going to want silver on hand. There are two ways to manage silver.
- You're really good at impulse control, and you make sure you go into a fusion with at least 20M silver.
- You're like me, and you keep on spending it here and there on top of market, because do what I say, not what I do, because it probably works a lot better, and you gear cleanse in a very lax manner. Only getting rid of the worst, when you're close to artifact capacity.

 The first method already works, skip to the next part, I admire your self control on silver spending.

 If you're more likely to use the second method, it has some pretty good advantages in my opinion. 
 - You get to be lazy on gear cleansing between fusions
 - You still can spend some silver on messing with your champs and their gear
 - You can cleanse when you need the silver, and that'll probably motivate you to **really** cleanse your gear of all the random stuff you know deep down you'll never use but you still keep.

Point is, save up however you see fit, but you'll need an initial amount, in silver or gear, to safeguard yourself from bad enhancement RNG. 16-20M has worked fairly well for me. The rest of the silver, you should get with all the dungeon running, and selling anything that's not **really** good

**TL;DR: Save up roughly 20M silver at least**

#### Food
In a general sense, I'd recommend pushing to the legendary book at least in all champ training events, even out of fusion, (possibly to the primal if it continues to be just 1K further than the lego book.) It's reliable, it's giving you food, lego books and silver, and it's honestly worth it.
With that in mind, I try to always keep my 100 slot reserve champion vault full with food. 
More higher ranks make it easier to do all the champ events. If you have spare energy, get some 4\* to level 40 and some 3\* to level 30, as those are, in my opinion, the two real painpoints of champ trainings. But again, **Fill your vault with market bought champions, they're free range, and not grown in shards, which we need for Summon Rush and Champion Chase**

**TL;DR: Keep 100+ champs as designated food ready for the fusion**

#### Summon Rush & Champ Chase prep
These will be what will make or break your fusion. Without the shards or equivalents, there is no easy way to complete the points needed besides pulling out the wallet. Which, again, we want to avoid.
Save all of them. 
You can grind "Shards" for champ chase, by banking fragment summons, fusions (like Broadmaw/Rhazin/Relickeeper) and possibly login rewards if they're not too far off from the champ chase dates. 
Google how to refuse daily rewards to save them. Keep in mind this will delay your daily login bonuses, so use at your own discretion. 

2000 mystery shards and 2 sacreds, both of which should be relatively reasonable to acquire in 1 month between fusions, should cover Summon Rush.

Champ chase is a bit more complicated. You can expect between 2,500-3,650 points being the target. On average, 50 ancients should get you about 1460 points, 2420 points during a x2. Plan accordingly.

### Week before

- Your food stores should be full, stop buying 2* champs from market
- Stop spending silver (besides mystery shards from market if you're still low on shards)
- Hoard all energy refills and gems if you're not very comfortable with what you have
If it's a fragment event, that's about it, you're ready to tackle the fusion itself.

If it's a traditional fusion, you're going to want readily available food & potions, so grind those up if you're not already done.
- 16 4* ready to be fed (either 4* lvl 1s, or 4* chickens work here)
- 24 superior potions of the affinity, and 12 Arcane
- 80 greater of the affinity, and 60 Arcane

### During the fusion

As much as possible, double dip events. Using the calendar above as an example, the first day of the fusion would be focused on :
- Rolling up gear to complete enhancement
- Using only the energy regen, and starting champion training with it.
  
Then, on day two, that would allow you to :
- Burn through energy on fire Knight, also progressing Dungeon Divers
- Summoning mystery shards for Summon Rush, and feeding the 1* to xp 2\* champs, progressing champ training

Coupling event progress to save on actual spending of your resources goes a very long way in fusions, as long as you can keep track of what you've pushed off to when, to make sure you don't miss an event by forgetting to finish it.

Unless you know you can afford it resource wise, skip all non fusion events besides arena.

- Finish all the events you need.
- Congrats, you have a fusion
